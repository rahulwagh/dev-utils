## ‚ú® Features

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive suite of tools that developers use every day.

### ### JSON Formatter & Validator
- **Beautify & Pretty-Print JSON:** Instantly format your messy JSON data into a clean, human-readable structure with proper indentation.
- **Validate & Debug:** Quickly find and fix syntax errors. The tool highlights issues directly, helping you debug invalid JSON.
- **Client-Side Processing:** Your data is processed securely in your browser and is never sent to a server.

### ### Base64 Encoder & Decoder
- **Encode to Base64:** Convert any text or string data into a Base64 encoded format for safe transmission in URLs or other text-based mediums.
- **Decode from Base64:** Instantly decode a Base64 string back to its original human-readable format.
- **Error Handling:** The tool validates the input to ensure it is a valid Base64 string before attempting to decode.

### ### URL Encoder & Decoder
- **Percent-Encoding:** Safely encode special characters (like `/`, `?`, `&`, `#`) in your URLs to ensure they are interpreted correctly by browsers and web servers.
- **Decode URL Components:** Convert encoded URI components back into their original characters for easy reading and debugging.

*More tools like a JWT Debugger and Unix Timestamp Converter are coming soon!*
